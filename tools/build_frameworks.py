"""The compliance framework catalogue: 7 families, 24 frameworks, with control counts.

THIS NO LONGER WRITES A PAGE. It used to build a per-framework coverage section on
products/complianceportal.html, which was deleted when the four unreleased products were collapsed
into products/coming.html. From then on it raised FileNotFoundError on every run, its
frameworks:start/end markers existed nowhere in the site, and README still advertised it - so a
maintainer coming to update a framework table got a traceback and had to work out for themselves
that the page was gone.

Deleting it was the obvious alternative and would have destroyed the only copy of this data.
tools/framework_stats.py, which generated these counts from the platform's framework packs, is not
in this repo; the numbers were pasted here precisely so the site could build without that checkout.
So the table stays, as data, and the parts of the site that quote it now derive their figures from
it instead of hand-typing them.

The numbers are read out of the packs, not estimated: each control declares `Automatable: true|false`,
which the domain defines as "expected to have a test/selector; otherwise it is manual-attestation
only". That is the split a buyer needs - what can be proved by inspecting configuration, and what
still needs a human to attest.

CIS packs are excluded deliberately (site-wide rule, see README).

Run: python tools/build_frameworks.py   - prints the catalogue; writes nothing.

          of the control, not a promise that every one of them is implemented today — coverage of that
          set is high but not complete, and the product reports per-control status rather than a
          headline percentage.</p>
