buyers actually search for.

These are the only asset on the site that compounds. Every other page has to
convert the traffic it is given; these earn traffic. Each one ends in the free

               "Find out what Copilot can reach in your own tenant."),
        body="""
      <h2>The rule, stated once</h2>
      <p>Copilot can surface, summarise and cite <strong>anything the person asking could already open
        themselves</strong>. It adds no access. It removes the friction that used to hide access nobody
        had audited.</p>
      <p>That distinction matters, because it means a Copilot rollout does not create a new security
        problem. It reveals one you already had, instantly, to every employee at once.</p>

      <h2>Where the exposure actually comes from</h2>
      <p>In practice, four patterns account for most of what surprises people.</p>
      <h3>1. Organisation-wide sharing links</h3>
      <p>A link created as "anyone in the organisation" is permanent, transferable and invisible in most
        reporting. Ten years of them accumulate. Each one is a document Copilot can now quote to anybody
        who asks a question near enough to its contents.</p>
      <h3>2. Company-wide groups used as convenience</h3>
      <p>"Everyone except external users" started as a shortcut for one intranet page. It is now attached
        to sites nobody remembers granting. This is the single most common cause of a Copilot answer that
        contains something a colleague should not have seen.</p>
      <h3>3. Inherited permissions on old sites</h3>
      <p>A site created from a template in 2019 inherits an access model designed for a team that no
        longer exists. Nobody checks, because nothing surfaced it — until something did.</p>
      <h3>4. Personal OneDrive sprawl</h3>
      <p>People store things in OneDrive precisely because it feels private, then share a folder once to
        collaborate on one file. The folder stays shared.</p>

      <h2>Why native reporting does not answer this</h2>
      <p>You can retrieve sharing information per workload, per site, in separate reports. What you cannot
        easily get is the question you actually need answered: <em>for this person, what would Copilot be
        able to reach, and which of that is sensitive?</em></p>
      <p>That requires joining the sharing surface to the permission model to the sensitivity of what sits
        behind it — across SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams and the groups underpinning all three. It is a
        crawl, not a report.</p>

      <h2>What to do before you roll out</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Inventory the sharing surface</strong> across every workload, not one at a time.</li>
        <li><strong>Find the org-wide links and company-wide groups</strong> first. They are the highest
          blast radius per item and usually the easiest to fix.</li>
        <li><strong>Score by sensitivity, not count.</strong> Four hundred shared lunch menus do not
          matter. One shared HR folder does.</li>
        <li><strong>Fix the top of the list, then re-run.</strong> Sharing sprawl regenerates; a one-off
          clean-up decays within months.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep the evidence.</strong> The scan that proves you fixed it is the same artefact
          your auditor wants next quarter.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>The uncomfortable part</h2>
      <p>Restricting Copilot tenant-wide — turning off search scope, delaying the rollout — treats the
        symptom and costs you the value you paid for. The exposure was there before Copilot and will
        outlast it. The links, the stale guests and the forwarding rules are a data-access problem that
        happens to have become visible.</p>

        h1="Getting to DMARC enforcement without breaking your mail",
        lede="Almost every domain sits at p=none, which monitors and blocks nothing. The reason is not "
             "ignorance — it is that enforcing without an inventory is genuinely dangerous.",
        offer=("spoofing-report.html", "Check my domain, free",
               "See your current posture and who is sending as you."),
        body="""
      <h2>Why so many domains stop at monitoring</h2>
      <p>Publishing <code>p=none</code> is safe and takes ten minutes. Publishing <code>p=reject</code>
        tells the world to throw away mail that fails authentication — and if you have missed a
        legitimate sender, you have just silently deleted your own invoices, your CRM notifications or
        your payroll provider's mail.</p>
      <p>So people publish <code>p=none</code>, collect reports nobody reads, and stop. The domain stays
        spoofable, which is the thing DMARC existed to fix.</p>

      <h2>The step everyone skips</h2>
      <p><strong>Inventory every sender before you touch the policy.</strong> Not the senders you think
        you have — the ones actually sending. In a typical organisation that list includes several
        systems nobody in IT remembers procuring: a marketing tool, a survey platform, an ancient
        on-premises scanner, a payroll system, and at least one thing a department bought on a card.</p>
      <p>That list only exists in DMARC aggregate reports. You publish <code>p=none</code> with a
        reporting address, wait for real traffic, and read what comes back. Two to four weeks of reports
        beats any amount of asking around.</p>

      <h2>A staged rollout that does not bite</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Publish <code>p=none</code> with aggregate reporting</strong> to a mailbox you will
          actually process. Nothing changes for anyone.</li>
        <li><strong>Collect for two to four weeks.</strong> Longer if you have monthly batch processes —
          the payroll run you miss is the one that hurts.</li>
        <li><strong>Authenticate the legitimate senders.</strong> Add them to SPF where the record has
          room, and prefer DKIM signing — SPF has a hard limit of ten DNS lookups and large estates hit
          it constantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Move to <code>p=quarantine</code> with a percentage.</strong> Start at
          <code>pct=10</code>. Failures go to junk rather than nowhere, so a mistake is recoverable and
          visible.</li>
        <li><strong>Raise the percentage as the reports stay clean</strong>, then move to
          <code>p=reject</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep watching.</strong> New senders appear whenever someone buys something. A domain
          that reached enforcement and stopped being monitored drifts back into breakage.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Three mistakes worth avoiding</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Blowing the SPF lookup limit.</strong> Ten DNS lookups, including nested includes.
          Past that, SPF fails permanently and mail that should pass does not.</li>
        <li><strong>Forgetting subdomains.</strong> A policy on the organisational domain does not
          protect subdomains unless you set <code>sp=</code> — and attackers know this.</li>
        <li><strong>Treating it as a project.</strong> It is a state to hold, not a task to close.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why it is worth finishing</h2>
      <p>Major mailbox providers now require DMARC for bulk senders. Brand indicators in the inbox need
        enforcement. Cyber-insurance questionnaires ask. And unauthenticated domains remain one of the
        cheapest attacks available to anyone targeting your customers or your finance team.</p>

        body="""
      <h2>The problem with the screenshot</h2>
      <p>The standard artefact in most compliance programmes is an image of a configuration screen,
        pasted into a document, dated by whoever took it. It shows one setting, at one moment, as
        rendered to one person — and it is trivially staged, accidentally or otherwise.</p>
      <p>Auditors accept them because the alternative has historically been nothing. That is tolerance,
        not confidence, and it is why the same control gets re-evidenced every single year.</p>

      <h2>What better evidence has</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>It is reproducible.</strong> Anyone with access can re-run it and get the same
          answer, rather than trusting an image.</li>
        <li><strong>It covers a period, not an instant.</strong> "This held every day for twelve months"
          is a different claim from "this was true in March".</li>
        <li><strong>It knows what it could not check.</strong> Evidence that reports "not assessed" where
          it lacked access is more credible than evidence that quietly reports a pass.</li>
        <li><strong>It is tamper-evident.</strong> A record that can be shown not to have been edited
          after the fact is worth more than one that merely has not been.</li>
        <li><strong>It maps to the control</strong>, not to a product feature — so it can satisfy
          overlapping requirements in several frameworks at once.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What cannot be automated, however good the tool</h2>
      <p>This is where most compliance vendors get vague, so plainly: a large share of any framework is
        not technical and never will be. Board oversight. Whether people took the training and understood
        it. Whether your risk assessment reflects reality. Physical security. Whether the vendor review
        actually happened or a box was ticked.</p>
      <p>For a sense of scale from a real catalogue: GDPR runs to 91 controls of which roughly 2 can be
        proved from configuration. It is a process regime with a technical footnote, and any tool
        claiming to make you GDPR compliant is selling you something that does not exist.</p>
      <p>Conversely, ISO 27001 and cloud-specific baselines sit near half automatable, because they are
        written about systems. Knowing which half you are looking at is most of the skill.</p>

      <h2>A practical split</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Automate everything that lives in configuration</strong>, and re-run it continuously
          rather than annually.</li>
        <li><strong>Attest the rest deliberately</strong>, with a named owner and an expiry date, so an
          attestation cannot outlive its truth.</li>
        <li><strong>Never let a gap score as a pass.</strong> A control you could not assess is a control
          you do not have evidence for, and recording it as green is how programmes rot.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep the security finding visible after the waiver.</strong> Waiving a control
          changes the report; it does not change the estate.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>The test to apply</h2>
      <p>For any control in your programme, ask: <em>if my auditor asked me to demonstrate this right
        now, live, could I?</em> If the answer is "I would have to go and take a screenshot", that
        control is evidenced by memory and goodwill rather than by proof.</p>
